Task :
Using the experimental data provided, find optimal parameters x for the model functions given by the model functions (1) and (2). Using these parameters, determine the coefficient of determination R2 for both of the models, compare the two models and give examples of two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphs by setting the value of one or two of the arguments to appropriate constants.
This is the outline of the main task further details are provided in the .pdf file :)
